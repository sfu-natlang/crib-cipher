 history from greek historia meaning inquiry knowledge acquired by investigation is the study of the past particularly how it relates to humans it is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory discovery collection organization presentation and interpretation of information about these events scholars who write about history are called historians events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory history can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing perspective on the problems of the present stories common to a particular culture but not supported by external sources such as the tales surrounding king arthur are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends because they do not support the disinterested investigation required of the discipline of history herodotus a th century bc greek historian is considered within the western tradition to be the father of history and along with his contemporary thucydides helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history their work continues to be read today and the divide between the culture focused herodotus and the military focused thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing in the eastern tradition a state chronicle the spring and autumn annals was known to be compiled from as early as bc although only nd century bc texts survived ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today the modern study of history is wide ranging and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies the word history comes ultimately from ancient greek histor a meaning inquiry knowledge from inquiry or judge it was in that sense that aristotle used the word in his per t z a istor ai inquiries about animals the ancestor word is attested early on in homeric hymns heraclitus the athenian ephebes oath and in boiotic inscriptions in a legal sense either judge or witness or similar the greek word was borrowed into classical latin as historia meaning investigation inquiry research account description written account of past events writing of history historical narrative recorded knowledge of past events story narrative history was borrowed from latin possibly via old irish or old welsh into old english as st r history narrative story but this word fell out of use in the late old english period meanwhile as latin became old french and anglo norman historia developed into forms such as istorie estoire and historie with new developments in the meaning account of the events of a person s life beginning of the th cent chronicle account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events c body of knowledge relative to human evolution science c narrative of real or imaginary events story c it was from anglo norman that history was borrowed into middle english and this time the loan stuck it appears in the thirteenth century ancrene riwle but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century with an early attestion appearing in john gower s confessio amantis of the s vi i finde in a bok compiled to this matiere an old histoire the which comth nou to mi memoire in middle english the meaning of history was story in general the restriction to the meaning the branch of knowledge that deals with past events the formal record or study of past events esp human affairs arose in the mid fifteenth century with the renaissance older senses of the word were revived and it was in the greek sense that francis bacon used the term in the late sixteenth century when he wrote about natural history for him historia was the knowledge of objects determined by space and time that sort of knowledge provided by memory while science was provided by reason and poetry was provided by fantasy in an expression of the linguistic synthetic vs analytic isolating dichotomy english like chinese vs now designates separate words for human history and storytelling in general in modern german french and most germanic and romance languages which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected the same word is still used to mean both history and story the adjective historical is attested from and historic from historian in the sense of a researcher of history is attested from in all european languages the substantive history is still used to mean both what happened with men and the scholarly study of the happened the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter history or the word historiography historians write in the context of their own time and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society in the words of benedetto croce all history is contemporary history history is facilitated by the formation of a true discourse of past through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race the modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse all events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record the task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past therefore the constitution of the historian s archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents by falsifying their claims to represent the true past the study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences it can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas incorporating methodologies from both some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification in the th century french historian fernand braudel revolutionized the study of history by using such outside disciplines as economics anthropology and geography in the study of global history traditionally historians have recorded events of the past either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts from the beginning historians have also used such sources as monuments inscriptions and pictures in general the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories what is written what is said and what is physically preserved and historians often consult all three but writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before archaeology is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects which once unearthed contribute to the study of history but archaeology rarely stands alone it uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries however archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history that is to say archaeology does not fill the gaps within textual sources indeed historical archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources for example mark leone the excavator and interpreter of historical annapolis maryland usa has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment despite the ideology of liberty inherent in written documents at this time there are varieties of ways in which history can be organized including chronologically culturally territorially and thematically these divisions are not mutually exclusive and significant overlaps are often present as in the international women s movement in an age of transition it is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general although the modern trend has been toward specialization the area called big history resists this specialization and searches for universal patterns or trends history has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity the history of the world is the memory of the past experience of homo sapiens sapiens around the world as that experience has been preserved largely in written records by prehistory historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist or where the writing of a culture is not understood by studying painting drawings carvings and other artifacts some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record since the th century the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history s implicit exclusion of certain civilizations such as those of sub saharan africa and pre columbian america historians in the west have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the western world in british historian e h carr wrote the line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future history begins with the handing down of tradition and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations this definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples such as australian aboriginals and new zealand m ori in the past and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations even before their contact with european civilization historiography has a number of related meanings firstly it can refer to how history has been produced the story of the development of methodology and practices for example the move from short term biographical narrative towards long term thematic analysis secondly it can refer to what has been produced a specific body of historical writing for example medieval historiography during the s means works of medieval history written during the s thirdly it may refer to why history is produced the philosophy of history as a meta level analysis of descriptions of the past this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives interpretations worldview use of evidence or method of presentation of other historians professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance if any of human history furthermore it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development that is it asks if there is a design purpose directive principle or finality in the processes of human history philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography which is the study of history as an academic discipline and thus concerns its methods and practices and its development as a discipline over time nor should philosophy of history be confused with the history of philosophy which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time the historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history herodotus of halicarnassus bc ca bc has generally been acclaimed as the father of history however his contemporary thucydides ca bc ca bc is credited with having first approached history with a well developed historical method in his work the history of the peloponnesian war thucydides unlike herodotus regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings and looked at cause and effect rather than as the result of divine intervention in his historical method thucydides emphasized chronology a neutral point of view and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings greek historians also viewed history as cyclical with events regularly recurring there were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval china the groundwork for professional historiography in east asia was established by the han dynasty court historian known as sima qian bc author of the shiji records of the grand historian for the quality of his written work sima qian is posthumously known as the father of chinese historiography chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in china used his shiji as the official format for historical texts as well as for biographical literature saint augustine was influential in christian and western thought at the beginning of the medieval period through the medieval and renaissance periods history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective around german philosopher and historian georg wilhelm friedrich hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study in the preface to his book the muqaddimah the arab historian and early sociologist ibn khaldun warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed in this criticism he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation the originality of ibn khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation and lastly to feel the need for experience in addition to rational principles in order to assess a culture of the past ibn khaldun often criticized idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data as a result he introduced a scientific method to the study of history and he often referred to it as his new science his historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state communication propaganda and systematic bias in history and he is thus considered to be the father of historiography or the father of the philosophy of history in the west historians developed modern methods of historiography in the th and th centuries especially in france and germany the th century historian with greatest influence on methods was leopold von ranke in germany in the th century academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives which often tended to glorify the nation or great men to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces a major trend of historical methodology in the th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art which traditionally had been the case some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included fernand braudel e h carr fritz fischer emmanuel le roy ladurie hans ulrich wehler bruce trigger marc bloch karl dietrich bracher peter gay robert fogel lucien febvre and lawrence stone many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi disciplinary approach braudel combined history with geography bracher history with political science fogel history with economics gay history with psychology trigger history with archaeology while wehler bloch fischer stone febvre and le roy ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology geography anthropology and economics more recently the field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship in opposition to the claims of history as a social science historians such as hugh trevor roper john lukacs donald creighton gertrude himmelfarb and gerhard ritter argued that the key to the historians work was the power of the imagination and hence contended that history should be understood as an art french historians associated with the annales school introduced quantitative history using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history cf histoire des mentalit s intellectual historians such as herbert butterfield ernst nolte and george mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history american historians motivated by the civil rights era focused on formerly overlooked ethnic racial and socio economic groups another genre of social history to emerge in the post wwii era was alltagsgeschichte history of everyday life scholars such as martin broszat ian kershaw and detlev peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in th century germany especially in the nazi period marxist historians such as eric hobsbawm e p thompson rodney hilton georges lefebvre eugene d genovese isaac deutscher c l r james timothy mason herbert aptheker arno j mayer and christopher hill have sought to validate karl marx s theories by analyzing history from a marxist perspective in response to the marxist interpretation of history historians such as fran ois furet richard pipes j c d clark roland mousnier henry ashby turner and robert conquest have offered anti marxist interpretations of history feminist historians such as joan wallach scott claudia koonz natalie zemon davis sheila rowbotham gisela bock gerda lerner elizabeth fox genovese and lynn hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past in recent years postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources in his book in defence of history richard j evans a professor of modern history at cambridge university defended the worth of history another defence of history from post modernist criticism was the australian historian keith windschuttle s book the killing of history the marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time in other words the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding clothing and housing themselves and their families overall marx and engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in western europe marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the soviet union but since the collapse of communism there in mikhail krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship marx observed that each stage or epoch created a new class or invention that would lead to its downfall however the downfall would not be an automatically negative event since with each step humanity at large would benefit each passing stage would therefore raise the standard of living of the masses while at the same time be doomed to its own downfall because of internal contradictions and class conflicts the first three stages are not given particular attention since by marx s time they had long come to pass as such he does not provide the principles of these stages as he does for capitalism and the stages that follow nonetheless these epochs have common characteristics historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time historians give these periods of time names in order to allow organising ideas and classificatory generalisations to be used by historians the names given to a period can vary with geographical location as can the dates of the start and end of a particular period centuries and decades are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the dating system used most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past the way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied the field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists who have entirely different sets of tools and theories the usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past in archeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology such as the stone age bronze age and iron age and their sub divisions also based on different styles of material remains despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts these long established schemes seem likely to remain in use in many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it which may be used the marxian theory of history identifies five stages of history the first stage is usually called primitive communism it has the following characteristics shared property there is no concept of ownership beyond individual possessions all is shared by the tribe to ensure its survival hunting and gathering tribal societies have yet to develop large scale agriculture and so their survival is a daily struggle proto democracy there is usually no concept of leadership yet so tribes are led by the best warrior if there is war the best diplomat if they have steady contact with other tribes and so forth the second stage may be called slave society considered to be the beginning of class society where private property appears class here the idea of class appears there is always a slave owning ruling class and the slaves themselves statism the state develops during this stage as a tool for the slave owners to use and control the slaves agriculture people learn to cultivate plants and animals on a large enough scale to support large populations democracy and authoritarianism these opposites develop at the same stage democracy arises first with the development of the republican city state followed by the totalitarian empire private property citizens now own more than personal property land ownership is especially important during a time of agricultural development the third stage may be called feudalism it appears after slave society collapses this was most obvious during the european middle ages when society went from slavery to feudalism aristocracy the state is ruled by monarchs who inherit their positions or at times marry or conquer their ways into leadership theocracy this is a time of largely religious rule when there is only one religion in the land and its organizations affect all parts of daily life hereditary classes castes can sometimes form and one s class is determined at birth with no form of advancement this was the case with india nation state nations are formed from the remnants of the fallen empires sometimes to rebuild themselves into empires once more such as england s transition from a province to an empire marx pays special attention to this stage in human development the bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism which in western society classically arose red in tooth and claw from feudal society in a revolutionary movement in capitalism the profit motive rules and people freed from serfdom work for the capitalists for wages the capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world in the capitalist controlled parliament laws are made to protect wealth capitalism may be considered the fourth stage in the sequence it appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists or their merchant predecessors overthrow the feudal system capitalism is categorized by the following market economy in capitalism the entire economy is guided by market forces supporters of laissez faire economics argue that there should be little or no intervention from the government under capitalism marxists however such as lenin in his imperialism the highest stage of capitalism argue that the capitalist government is a powerful instrument for the furtherance of capitalism and the capitalist nation state particularly in the conquest of markets abroad private property the means of production are no longer in the hands of the monarchy and its nobles but rather they are controlled by the capitalists the capitalists control the means of production through commercial enterprises such as corporations which aim to maximise profit parliamentary democracy the capitalists tend to govern through an elected centralised parliament or congress rather than under an autocracy capitalist bourgeois democracy although it may be extended to the whole population does not necessarily lead to universal suffrage historically it has excluded by force segregation legislation or other means sections of the population such as women slaves ex slaves people of colour or those on low income the government acts on behalf of and is controlled by the capitalists through various methods wages in capitalism workers are rewarded according to their contract with their employer power elites propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an equilibrium at which workers are paid for precisely the value of their services in reality workers are paid less than the value of their productivity the difference forming profit for the employer in this sense all paid employment is exploitation and the worker is alienated from their work insofar as the profit motive drives the market it is impossible for workers to be paid for the full value of their labour as all employers will act in the same manner imperialism wealthy countries seek to dominate poorer countries in order to gain access to raw materials and to provide captive markets for finished products this is done directly through war the threat of war or the export of capital the capitalist s control over the state can play an essential part in the development of capitalism to the extent the state directs warfare and other foreign intervention financial institutions banks and capital markets such as stock exchanges direct unused capital to where it is needed they reduce barriers to entry in all markets especially to the poor it is in this way that banks dramatically improve class mobility monopolistic tendencies the natural unrestrained market forces will create monopolies from the most successful commercial entities but according to marx capitalism like slave society and feudalism also has critical failings inner contradictions which will lead to its downfall the working class to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits is the grave digger of capitalism the worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces the rest is surplus value the capitalist s profit which marx calls the unpaid labour of the working class the capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase their profits and this creates conflict between the classes and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working class the working class through trade union and other struggles becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class in the view of classical marxism the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production after the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the capitalists socialism which may be considered the fifth stage will be attained if the workers are successful socialism may be characterised as follows common property the means of production are taken from the hands of a few capitalists and put in the hands of the workers this translates into the democratic communes controlling the means of production council democracy marx basing himself on a thorough study of paris commune believed that the workers would govern themselves through system of communes he called this the dictatorship of the proletariat which overthrowing the dictatorship governance of capital would democratically plan production and the resources of the planet marx explained that since socialism the first stage of communism would be in every respect economically morally and intellectually still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes despite the fact that each worker s ability and family circumstances would differ so that the results would still be unequal at this stage although fully supported by social provision particular geographical locations can form the basis of historical study for example continents countries and cities understanding why historic events took place is important to do this historians often turn to geography weather patterns the water supply and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there for example to explain why the ancient egyptians developed a successful civilization studying the geography of egypt is essential egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the nile river which flooded each year depositing soil on its banks the rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities that meant everyone did not have to farm so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization history of africa begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states history of the americas is the collective history of north and south america including central america and the caribbean history of north america is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the earth s northern and western hemisphere history of central america is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the earth s western hemisphere history of the caribbean begins with the oldest evidence where year old remains have been found history of south america is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the earth s southern and western hemisphere history of antarctica emerges from early western theories of a vast continent known as terra australis believed to exist in the far south of the globe history of australia starts with the documentation of the makassar trading with indigenous australians on australia s north coast history of new zealand dates back at least years to when it was discovered and settled by polynesians who developed a distinct m ori culture centred on kinship links and land history of the pacific islands covers the history of the islands in the pacific ocean history of eurasia is the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions the middle east south asia east asia southeast asia and europe linked by the interior mass of the eurasian steppe of central asia and eastern europe history of europe describes the passage of time from humans inhabiting the european continent to the present day history of asia can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions east asia south asia and the middle east linked by the interior mass of the eurasian steppe history of east asia is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in east asia history of the middle east begins with the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the middle east that were established around bc in mesopotamia iraq history of south asia is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the sub himalayan region history of southeast asia has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers military history concerns warfare strategies battles weapons and the psychology of combat the new military history since the s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals with psychology more than tactics and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture the history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe leading journals include church history catholic historical review and history of religions topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions to theology and liturgy this subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived social history sometimes called the new social history is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life in its golden age it was a major growth field in the s and s among scholars and still is well represented in history departments in two decades from to the proportion of professors of history in american universities identifying with social history rose from to while the proportion of political historians fell from to in the history departments of british universities in of the faculty members identified themselves with social history while political history came next with the old social history before the s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme and it often included political movements like populism that were social in the sense of being outside the elite system social history was contrasted with political history intellectual history and the history of great men english historian g m trevelyan saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history reflecting that without social history economic history is barren and political history unintelligible while the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out it has also been defended as history with the people put back in the chief subfields of social history include cultural history replaced social history as the dominant form in the s and s it typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience it examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge customs and arts of a group of people how peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images and human visual production iconography diplomatic history focuses on the relationships between nations primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars more recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights it typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office and long term strategic values as the driving force of continuity and change in history this type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time historian muriel chamberlain notes that after the first world war diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation at once the most important most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies she adds that after the trend reversed allowing social history to replace it although economic history has been well established since the late th century in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments business history deals with the history of individual business organizations business methods government regulation labor relations and impact on society it also includes biographies of individual companies executives and entrepreneurs it is related to economic history business history is most often taught in business schools environmental history is a new field that emerged in the s to look at the history of the environment especially in the long run and the impact of human activities upon it world history is the study of major civilizations over the last years or so world history is primarily a teaching field rather than a research field it gained popularity in the united states japan and other countries after the s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds it has led to highly controversial interpretations by oswald spengler and arnold j toynbee among others the world history association publishes the journal of world history every quarter since the h world discussion list serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history with discussions among scholars announcements syllabi bibliographies and book reviews a people s history is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the perspective of common people a people s history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus which includes the disenfranchised the oppressed the poor the nonconformists and the otherwise forgotten people this history also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur historiometry is a historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics by using statistics to analyze references to eminent persons their statements behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts gender history is a sub field of history and gender studies which looks at the past from the perspective of gender it is in many ways an outgrowth of women s history despite its relatively short life gender history and its forerunner women s history has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history since the s when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance it has gone through a number of different phases each with its own challenges and outcomes although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession other influences are more subtle public history describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation archival science oral history museum curatorship and other related fields the term itself began to be used in the u s and canada in the late s and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time some of the most common settings for public history are museums historic homes and historic sites parks battlefields archives film and television companies and all levels of government professional and amateur historians discover collect organize and present information about past events in lists of historians historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized chroniclers and annalists though they are not historians in the true sense are also frequently included since the th century western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the judgement of history the goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final a related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory pseudohistory is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard historiographical conventions in a way which undermines their conclusions closely related to deceptive historical revisionism works which draw controversial conclusions from new speculative or disputed historical evidence particularly in the fields of national political military and religious affairs are often rejected as pseudohistory a major intellectual battle took place in britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities at oxford and cambridge scholarship was downplayed professor charles harding firth oxford s regius professor of history in ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists the oxford tutors who had more votes than the professors fought back in defense of their system saying that it successfully produced britain s outstanding statesmen administrators prelates and diplomats and that mission was as valuable as training scholars the tutors dominated the debate until after the second world war it forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools such as manchester university where t f tout was professionalising the history undergraduate programme at by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis in the united states scholarship was concentrated at the major phd producing universities while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching a tendency in the st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure track faculty furthermore universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching from the origins of national school systems in the th century the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority in the united states after world war i a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in western civilization so as to give students a common heritage with europe in the u s after attention increasingly moved toward teaching world history or requiring students to take courses in non western cultures to prepare students for life in a globalized economy at the university level historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities many view the field from both perspectives the teaching of history in french schools was influenced by the nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the s by cahiers p dagogiques and enseignement and other journals for teachers also influential was the institut national de recherche et de documentation p dagogique inrdp joseph leif the inspector general of teacher training said pupils children should learn about historians approaches as well as facts and dates louis fran ois dean of the history geography group in the inspectorate of national education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote active methods which would give pupils the immense happiness of discovery proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of french patriotism and national identity in most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism and give students the official line about national enemies in many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light for example in japan mention of the nanking massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire second world war is given cursory treatment other countries have complained it was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid marxist historiography academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks sometimes with success in st century germany the history curriculum is controlled by the states and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone and reflects principles formulated by international organizations such as unesco or the council of europe thus oriented towards human rights democracy and peace the result is that german textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy progress human rights peace tolerance and europeanness annals auxiliary sciences of history chronicle historian list
