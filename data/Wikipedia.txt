 wikipedia w k pi di or w ki pi di wik i pee dee is a free access free content internet encyclopedia supported and hosted by the non profit wikimedia foundation those who can access the site can edit most of its articles editors are expected to follow the website s rules wikipedia is ranked among the ten most popular websites and constitutes the internet s largest and most popular general reference work jimmy wales and larry sanger launched wikipedia on january sanger coined its name a portmanteau of wiki and encyclo pedia initially only in english wikipedia quickly became multilingual as it developed similar versions in other languages which differ in content and in editing practices the english wikipedia is now one of more than wikipedias and is the largest with over million articles there is a grand total including all wikipedias of nearly million articles in different languages as of february it had billion page views and nearly million unique visitors each month globally wikipedia had more than million accounts out of which there were about active editors as of november supporters of wikipedia cite a survey of wikipedia published in nature based on a comparison of science articles with encyclop dia britannica which found that wikipedia s level of accuracy approached encyclop dia britannica s criticisms of wikipedia include claims that it exhibits systemic bias presents a mixture of truths half truths and some falsehoods and is subject to manipulation and spin unlike traditional encyclopedias wikipedia follows the procrastination principle regarding the security of its content it started almost entirely open anyone could create articles and any wikipedia article could be edited by any reader even those who did not have a wikipedia account modifications to all articles would be published immediately as a result any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors ideological biases and nonsensical or irrelevant text over time the english wikipedia and some other wikipedias gradually restricted modifications for example in the english wikipedia and some other language editions only registered users may create a new article on the english wikipedia and some others some particularly sensitive and or vandalism prone pages are now protected to some degree a frequently vandalized article can be semi protected meaning that only certain editors are able to modify it a particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes in certain cases all editors are allowed to submit modifications but review is required for some editors for example the german wikipedia maintains stable versions of articles which have passed certain reviews following protracted trials and community discussion the english wikipedia introduced the pending changes system in december under this system new users edits to certain controversial or vandalism prone articles are subject to review from an established wikipedia editor before publication although changes are not systematically reviewed the software that powers wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others the history page of each article links to each revision on most articles anyone can undo others changes by clicking a link on the article s history page anyone can view the latest changes to articles and anyone may maintain a watchlist of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes new pages patrol is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems in economics phd student andrea ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor creative construction over creative destruction any edit that changes content in a way that deliberately compromises the integrity of wikipedia is considered vandalism the most common and obvious types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude humor vandalism can also include advertising language and other types of spam sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page less common types of vandalism such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting modify page semantics such as the page s title or categorization manipulate the underlying code of an article or use images disruptively obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from wiki articles the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes however some vandalism takes much longer to repair in the wikipedia seigenthaler biography incident an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of american political figure john seigenthaler in may seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of john f kennedy the article remained uncorrected for four months seigenthaler the founding editorial director of usa today and founder of the freedom forum first amendment center at vanderbilt university called wikipedia co founder jimmy wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation wales replied that he did not although the perpetrator was eventually traced after the incident seigenthaler described wikipedia as a flawed and irresponsible research tool this incident led to policy changes at wikipedia specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people see also wikipedia five pillars content in wikipedia is subject to the laws in particular copyright laws of the united states and of the u s state of virginia where the majority of wikipedia s servers are located beyond legal matters the editorial principles of wikipedia are embodied in the five pillars and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content even these rules are stored in wiki form and wikipedia editors write and revise the website s policies and guidelines editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non compliant material originally rules on the non english editions of wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the english wikipedia they have since diverged to some extent according to the rules on the english wikipedia each entry in wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary like a topic should also meet wikipedia s standards of notability which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article s subject further wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized it must not present original research a claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source among wikipedia editors this is often phrased as verifiability not truth to express the idea that the readers not the encyclopedia are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations this can at times lead to the removal of information that is valid finally wikipedia must not take sides all opinions and viewpoints if attributable to external sources must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article this is known as neutral point of view npov wikipedia s initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time a small number of administrators are allowed to modify any article and an even smaller number of bureaucrats can name new administrators an article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor and is not vetted by any recognized authority avoidance of a tragedy of the commons is attempted with the attention of individual wikipedians editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship this begins with administrator privileged users who can delete pages prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes and try to prevent certain persons from editing despite the name administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision making instead their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits such as vandalism fewer editors become administrators than in years past in part because the process of vetting potential wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous wikipedians may dispute for example by repeatedly making opposite changes to an article over time wikipedia has developed documentation for editors about dispute resolution in order to determine community consensus editors can raise issues at the village pump or initiate a request for comment the arbitration committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read the arbitration committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate therefore the committee does not dictate the content of articles although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates wikipedia policies for example if the new content is considered biased its remedies include cautions and probations used in of cases and banning editors from articles subject matters or wikipedia complete bans from wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti social behavior when conduct is not impersonation or anti social but rather anti consensus or in violation of editing policies remedies tend to be limited to warnings each article and each user of wikipedia has an associated talk page these form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss coordinate and debate wikipedia s community has been described as cult like although not always with entirely negative connotations the project s preference for cohesiveness even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials has been referred to as anti elitism wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work these personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support administrative actions and types of articulation work wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification as wikipedia grew who writes wikipedia became one of the questions frequently asked on the project jimmy wales once argued that only a community a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers makes the bulk of contributions to wikipedia and that the project is therefore much like any traditional organization in a slate magazine article reported that according to researchers in palo alto percent of wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site s edits this method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by aaron swartz who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content measured by number of characters contributed by users with low edit counts a report in august showed that wikipedia had at least editors a significant decline in the number of english language editors was reported in by tom simonite who stated the number of active editors on the english language wikipedia peaked in at more than and has been declining ever since t his past summer only people could be considered active editors several attempts to explain this have been offered one possible explanation is that some users become turned off by their experiences another explanation according to eric goldman is found in editors who fail to comply with wikipedia cultural rituals such as signing talk pages implicitly signal that they are wikipedia outsiders increasing the odds that wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions becoming a wikipedia insider involves non trivial costs the contributor is expected to build a user page learn wikipedia specific technological codes submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process and learn a baffling culture rich with in jokes and insider references editors who do not log in are in some sense second class citizens on wikipedia as participants are accredited by members of the wiki community who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product on the basis of their ongoing participation but the contribution histories of ip addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty a study by researchers from dartmouth college found that anonymous and infrequent contributors to wikipedia are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site jimmy wales stated in that i t turns out over of all the edits are done by just of the users people and in fact the most active which is people have done of all the edits however business insider editor and journalist henry blodget showed in that in a random sample of articles most content in wikipedia measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit is created by outsiders while most editing and formatting is done by insiders a study found that wikipedians were less agreeable open and conscientious than others according to a study there is evidence of growing resistance from the wikipedia community to new content one study found that the contributor base to wikipedia was barely women the average age of a contributor was in the mid s a study by researchers from the university of minnesota found that females comprised of the editors who started editing wikipedia during in a january new york times article noam cohen observed that just of wikipedia s contributors are female according to a wikimedia foundation survey sue gardner a former executive director of the wikimedia foundation hoped to see female contributions increase to twenty five percent by linda basch president of the national council for research on women noted the contrast in these wikipedia editor statistics with the percentage of women currently completing bachelor s degrees master s degrees and phd programs in the united states all at rates of percent or greater in response various universities have hosted edit a thons to encourage more women to participate in the wikipedia community in fall colleges and universities including yale brown and pennsylvania state offered college credit for students to write feminist thinking about technology into wikipedia in august wikipedia co founder jimmy wales announced in a bbc interview the wikimedia foundation s plans for doubling down on the issue of gender bias on wikipedia wales agreed that sue gardner s goal of women enrollment by had not been met wales said the foundation would be open to more outreach more software changes and more women administrators software changes were left open to explore ways of increasing the appeal of wikipedia to attract women readers to register as editors and to increase the potential of existing editors to nominate more women administrators to enhance the management presence of women at wikipedia there are currently language editions of wikipedia also called language versions or simply wikipedias twelve of these have over one million articles each english swedish dutch german french waray waray russian cebuano italian spanish vietnamese and polish three more have over articles japanese portuguese and chinese more have over articles and more have over articles the largest the english wikipedia has over million articles as of may according to alexa the english subdomain en wikipedia org english wikipedia receives approximately of wikipedia s cumulative traffic with the remaining split among the other languages japanese spanish german russian as of june the six largest language editions are in order of article count the english swedish german dutch french and waray waray wikipedias the unit for the numbers in bars is articles since wikipedia is based on the web and therefore worldwide contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries as is the case for the english edition these differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences e g colour versus color or points of view though the various language editions are held to global policies such as neutral point of view they diverge on some points of policy and practice most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use jimmy wales has described wikipedia as an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language though each language edition functions more or less independently some efforts are made to supervise them all they are coordinated in part by meta wiki the wikimedia foundation s wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects wikipedia and others for instance meta wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of wikipedia and it maintains a list of articles every wikipedia should have the list concerns basic content by subject biography history geography society culture science technology and mathematics as for the rest it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition for example articles about small towns in the united states might only be available in english even when they meet notability criteria of other language wikipedia projects translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions in part because fully automated translation of articles is disallowed articles available in more than one language may offer interwiki links which link to the counterpart articles in other editions a study published by plos one in also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of wikipedia from different regions of the world it reported that the proportion of the edits made from north america was for the english wikipedia and for the simple english wikipedia the wikimedia foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the global south to thirty seven percent by on march the economist in an article titled the future of wikipedia cited a trend analysis concerning data published by wikimedia stating that the number of editors for the english language version has fallen by a third in seven years the attrition rate for active editors in english wikipedia was cited by the economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for wikipedia in other languages non english wikipedia the economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits per month was relatively constant since for wikipedia in other languages at approximately editors within narrow seasonal variances of about editors up or down the attrition rates for editors in english wikipedia by sharp comparison were cited as peaking in at approximately editors which has dropped to editors as of the start of at the quoted trend rate the number of active editors in english wikipedia has lost approximately editors to attrition since and the documented trend rate indicates the loss of another editors by down to active editors on english wikipedia by if left unabated given that the trend analysis published in the economist presents the number of active editors for wikipedia in other languages non english wikipedia as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers at approximately active editors the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness of wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis no comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from wikipedia in other languages non english wikipedia would provide a possible alternative to english wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the english language wikipedia wikipedia began as a complementary project for nupedia a free online english language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process nupedia was founded on march under the ownership of bomis a web portal company its main figures were the bomis ceo jimmy wales and larry sanger editor in chief for nupedia and later wikipedia nupedia was licensed initially under its own nupedia open content license switching to the gnu free documentation license before wikipedia s founding at the urging of richard stallman sanger and wales founded wikipedia while wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal on january sanger proposed on the nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a feeder project for nupedia wikipedia was formally launched on january as a single english language edition at www wikipedia com and announced by sanger on the nupedia mailing list wikipedia s policy of neutral point of view was codified in its first months otherwise there were relatively few rules initially and wikipedia operated independently of nupedia originally bomis intended to make wikipedia a business for profit wikipedia gained early contributors from nupedia slashdot postings and web search engine indexing by august wikipedia had over articles on september wikipedia had over articles and by the end of it had grown to approximately articles and language editions it had reached language editions by late by the end of and by the final days of nupedia and wikipedia coexisted until the former s servers were taken down permanently in and its text was incorporated into wikipedia english wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on september making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled surpassing even the yongle encyclopedia which had held the record for years citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in wikipedia users of the spanish wikipedia forked from wikipedia to create the enciclopedia libre in february these moves encouraged wales to announce that wikipedia would not display advertisements and to change wikipedia s domain from wikipedia com to wikipedia org though the english wikipedia reached three million articles in august the growth of the edition in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors appears to have peaked around early around articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in by that average was roughly a team at the palo alto research center attributed this slowing of growth to the project s increasing exclusivity and resistance to change others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called low hanging fruit topics that clearly merit an article have already been created and built up extensively in november a researcher at the rey juan carlos university in madrid spain found that the english wikipedia had lost editors during the first three months of in comparison the project lost only editors during the same period in the wall street journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend wales disputed these claims in denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study two years later wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline noting a decrease from a little more than writers in june to in june in the same interview wales also claimed the number of editors was stable and sustainable a claim which was questioned by mit s technology review in a article titled the decline of wikipedia in july the atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline in the november issue of new york magazine katherine ward stated wikipedia the sixth most used website is facing an internal crisis in mit s technology review revealed that since the site has lost a third of the volunteer editors who update and correct the online encyclopedia s millions of pages and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae in january wikipedia entered for the first time the top ten list of the most popular websites in the united states according to comscore networks with million unique visitors wikipedia was ranked number surpassing the new york times and apple this marked a significant increase over january when the rank was number with wikipedia receiving around million unique visitors as of march wikipedia has rank among websites in terms of popularity according to alexa internet in it received billion pageviews every month on february the new york times reported that wikipedia has billion page views and nearly million unique visitors a month according to the ratings firm comscore on january the english wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the united states congress the stop online piracy act sopa and the protect ip act pipa by blacking out its pages for hours more than million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced wikipedia content loveland and reagle argue that in process wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements piecemeal through stigmergic accumulation on january subodh varma reporting for the economic times indicated that not only had wikipedia growth flattened but that it has lost nearly per cent of its page views last year that s a decline of about billion between december and december its most popular versions are leading the slide page views of the english wikipedia declined by per cent those of german version slid by per cent and the japanese version lost per cent varma added that while wikipedia s managers think that this could be due to errors in counting other experts feel that google s knowledge graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up wikipedia users when contacted on this matter clay shirky associate professor at new york university and fellow at harvard s berkman center for internet and security indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to knowledge graphs stating if you can get your question answered from the search page you don t need to click any further some sites have been developed to criticize some of wikipedia s aspects like paid advocacy several wikipedians have criticized wikipedia s large and growing regulation which includes over policies and nearly words as of critics have stated that wikipedia exhibits systemic bias edwin black criticizes wikipedia for being a mixture of truth half truth and some falsehoods articles in the chronicle of higher education and the journal of academic librarianship have criticized wikipedia s undue weight policy concluding that the fact that wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject but rather only present the majority weight of viewpoints creates omissions which can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information journalists oliver kamm and edwin black noted how articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices usually by a group with an ax to grind on the topic an article in education next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin in the wikipedia watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism in the english wikipedia articles for traditional encyclopedias such as encyclop dia britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy conversely wikipedia is often cited for factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations however a peer review in of forty two scientific entries on both wikipedia and encyclop dia britannica by the science journal nature found few differences in accuracy and concluded that the average science entry in wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies britannica about three reagle suggested that while the study reflects a topical strength of wikipedia contributors in science articles wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects the findings by nature were disputed by encyclop dia britannica and in response nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by britannica in addition to the point for point disagreement between these two parties others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the nature effort and suggested a flawed study design in nature s manual selection of articles in part or in whole for comparison absence of statistical analysis e g of reported confidence intervals and a lack of study statistical power i e owing to small sample size or x articles compared vs gt and gt set sizes for britannica and the english wikipedia respectively as a consequence of the open structure wikipedia makes no guarantee of validity of its content since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it concerns have been raised by pc world in regarding the lack of accountability that results from users anonymity the insertion of false information vandalism and similar problems economist tyler cowen wrote if i had to guess whether wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think i would opt for wikipedia he comments that some traditional sources of non fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results in his opinion are over reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports however he also cautions that errors are frequently found on internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them critics argue that wikipedia s open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable some commentators suggest that wikipedia may be reliable but that the reliability of any given article is not clear editors of traditional reference works such as the encyclop dia britannica have questioned the project s utility and status as an encyclopedia wikipedia s open structure inherently makes it an easy target for internet trolls spammers and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia in response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues wikipedia was reported in an article by jeff elder in the wall street journal on june to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing the article stated that beginning monday from date of article changes in wikipedia s terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement katherine maher the nonprofit wikimedia foundation s chief communications officer said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that we re not an advertising service we re an encyclopedia these issues among others had been parodied since the first decade of wikipedia notably by stephen colbert on the colbert report most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work preferring primary sources some specifically prohibit wikipedia citations wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citeable sources and should not be relied upon as authoritative wales once or earlier said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited wikipedia he told the students they got what they deserved for god s sake you re in college don t cite the encyclopedia he said in february an article in the harvard crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at harvard university include wikipedia in their syllabi but that there is a split in their perception of using wikipedia in june former president of the american library association michael gorman condemned wikipedia along with google stating that academics who endorse the use of wikipedia are the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of big macs with everything a harvard law textbook legal research in a nutshell cites wikipedia as a general source that can be a real boon in coming up to speed in the law governing a situation and while not authoritative can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in depth resources on march julie beck writing for the atlantic magazine in an article titled doctors source for healthcare information wikipedia stated that fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the wikipedia site and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information beck continued to detail in this article new programs of dr amin azzam at the university of san francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve wikipedia articles on health related issues as well as internal quality control programs within wikipedia organized by dr james heilman to improve a group of health related articles of central medical importance up to wikipedia s highest standard of peer review evaluated articles using its featured article and good article peer review evaluation standards in a may follow up article in the atlantic titled can wikipedia ever be a definitive medical text julie beck quotes wikiproject medicine s dr james heilman as stating just because a reference is peer reviewed doesn t mean it s a high quality reference beck added that wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as good or featured heilman who has participated in that process before says less than percent of wikipedia s medical articles have passed because contributors usually rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full length revisions high and low quality content may be intermingled within an entry roy rosenzweig a history professor stated that american national biography online outperformed wikipedia in terms of its clear and engaging prose which he said was an important aspect of good historical writing contrasting wikipedia s treatment of abraham lincoln to that of civil war historian james mcpherson in american national biography online he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in lincoln s life but praised mcpherson s richer contextualization his artful use of quotations to capture lincoln s voice and his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words by contrast he gives an example of wikipedia s prose that he finds both verbose and dull rosenzweig also criticized the waffling encouraged by the npov policy which means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in wikipedia history by example he quoted the conclusion of wikipedia s article on william clarke quantrill while generally praising the article he pointed out its waffling conclusion some historians remember him as an opportunistic bloodthirsty outlaw while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero other critics have made similar charges that even if wikipedia articles are factually accurate they are often written in a poor almost unreadable style frequent wikipedia critic andrew orlowski commented even when a wikipedia entry is per cent factually correct and those facts have been carefully chosen it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into to a third passing an illiterate translator at each stage a study of articles on cancer was undertaken in by yaacov lawrence of the kimmel cancer center at thomas jefferson university limited to those wikipedia articles which could be found in the physician data query and excluding wikipedia articles written at the start class or the stub class level lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable and thought that wikipedia s lack of readability to non college readers may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing the economist argued that better written articles tend to be more reliable inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article since it has terabytes of disk space it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia the exact degree and manner of coverage on wikipedia is under constant review by its editors and disagreements are not uncommon see deletionism and inclusionism wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable offensive or pornographic because wikipedia is not censored the policy has sometimes proved controversial in wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of muhammad in the english edition of its muhammad article citing this policy the presence of politically religiously and pornographically sensitive materials in wikipedia has led to the censorship of wikipedia by national authorities in china pakistan and the united kingdom among other countries a study conducted by researchers at carnegie mellon university and palo alto research center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth from july to january in each field these numbers refer only to the quantity of articles it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones through its wikipedia loves libraries program wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the new york public library for the performing arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles a study conducted by researchers at the university of minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics there was a greater concentration of females in the people and arts category while males focus more on geography and science research conducted by the oxford internet institute has shown that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven africa is most underrepresented a selection bias may arise when more words per article are devoted to one public figure than a rival public figure editors may dispute suspected biases and discuss controversial articles sometimes at great length when multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics there may arise a systemic bias such as non opposite definitions for apparent antonyms in wales noted that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors which predominantly consists of young males with high education levels in the developed world cf previously the october essay by tom simonite in mit s technology review titled the decline of wikipedia discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors systemic bias on wikipedia may follow that of culture generally for example favouring certain ethnicities or majority religions it may more specifically follow the biases of internet culture inclining to being young male english speaking educated technologically aware and wealthy enough to spare time for editing biases of its own may include over emphasis on topics such as pop culture technology and current events taha yasseri of the university of oxford in studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution his research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring yasseri contended that simple reverts or undo operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting reverting reverted pairs or mutually reverting edit pairs such a mutually reverting edit pair is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then in sequence returns to revert the first editor in the mutually reverting edit pairs the results were tabulated for several language versions of wikipedia the english wikipedia s three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles george w bush anarchism and muhammad by comparison for the german wikipedia the three largest conflict rates at the time of the oxford study were for the articles covering i croatia ii scientology and iii conspiracy theories wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information of graphic content articles depicting arguably objectionable content such as feces cadaver human penis and vulva contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet including children the site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation photographs of nude children illustrations of zoophilia and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles the wikipedia article about virgin killer a album from german heavy metal band scorpions features a picture of the album s original cover which depicts a naked prepubescent girl the original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries in december access to the wikipedia article virgin killer was blocked for four days by most internet service providers in the united kingdom after it was reported by a member of the public as child pornography to the internet watch foundation iwf which issues a stop list to internet service providers iwf a non profit non government affiliated organization later criticized the inclusion of the picture as distasteful in april sanger wrote a letter to the federal bureau of investigation outlining his concerns that two categories of images on wikimedia commons contained child pornography and were in violation of us federal obscenity law sanger later clarified that the images which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon were not of real children but said that they constituted obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children under the protect act of that law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under american law sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on wikipedia in schools wikimedia foundation spokesman jay walsh strongly rejected sanger s accusation saying that wikipedia did not have material we would deem to be illegal if we did we would remove it following the complaint by sanger wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community after some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co founder status he wrote in a message to the wikimedia foundation mailing list that this action was in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical content issues rather than be about me and how quickly i acted critics including wikipediocracy noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from wikipedia since have reappeared one privacy concern in the case of wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a private citizen rather than a public figure in the eyes of the law it is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life meatspace a particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a wikipedia page against her or his wishes in january a german court ordered the german wikipedia shut down within germany because it stated the full name of boris floricic aka tron a deceased hacker on february the injunction against wikimedia deutschland was overturned with the court rejecting the notion that tron s right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated wikipedia has a volunteer response team that uses the otrs system to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties this is used for example in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project a group of wikipedia editors may form a wikiproject to focus their work on a specific topic area using its associated discussion page to coordinate changes across multiple articles wikipedia is hosted and funded by the wikimedia foundation a non profit organization which also operates wikipedia related projects such as wiktionary and wikibooks the foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission wikimedia chapters local associations of users and supporters of the wikimedia projects also participate in the promotion development and funding of the project the foundation s irs form shows revenue of million and expenses of almost million with assets of million and liabilities of about million in may wikimedia foundation named lila tretikov as its new executive director taking over for sue gardner the wall street journal reported on may that tretikov s information technology background from her years at university of california offers wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that information like air wants to be free the same wall street journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman jay walsh of wikimedia who said tretikov would address that issue paid advocacy as a priority we are really pushing toward more transparency we are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors better mobile support of wikipedia new geo location tools to find local content more easily and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities walsh said the operation of wikipedia depends on mediawiki a custom made free and open source wiki software platform written in php and built upon the mysql database system the software incorporates programming features such as a macro language variables a transclusion system for templates and url redirection mediawiki is licensed under the gnu general public license and it is used by all wikimedia projects as well as many other wiki projects originally wikipedia ran on usemodwiki written in perl by clifford adams phase i which initially required camelcase for article hyperlinks the present double bracket style was incorporated later starting in january phase ii wikipedia began running on a php wiki engine with a mysql database this software was custom made for wikipedia by magnus manske the phase ii software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand in july phase iii wikipedia shifted to the third generation software mediawiki originally written by lee daniel crocker several mediawiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the mediawiki software in april a lucene extension was added to mediawiki s built in search and wikipedia switched from mysql to lucene for searching the site currently uses lucene search which is written in java and based on lucene library in july after extensive beta testing a wysiwyg what you see is what you get extension visualeditor was opened to public use it was met with much rejection and criticism and was described as slow and buggy the feature was turned off afterward computer programs called bots have been used widely to perform simple and repetitive tasks such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data one controversial contributor massively creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to ten thousand articles on the swedish wikipedia on certain days there are also some bots designed to automatically warn editors making common editing errors such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parenthesis edits misidentified by a bot as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors an anti vandal bot tries to detect and revert vandalism quickly and automatically bots can also report edits from particular accounts or ip address ranges as was done at the time of the mh jet downing incident in july bots on wikipedia must be approved prior to activation according to andrew lih the current expansion of wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots a wikiproject is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve wikipedia these groups often focus on a specific topic area for example women s history a specific location or a specific kind of task for example checking newly created pages the english wikipedia currently has over wikiprojects and activity varies in in preparation for producing a print version the english wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles articles are rated by wikiprojects the range of quality classes begins with stub very short pages followed by start c and b in increasing order of quality community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality classes either a good article or the highest featured article of the about million articles and lists assessed as of march a little more than are featured articles and a little less than are featured lists one featured article per day as selected by editors appears on the main page of wikipedia the articles can also be rated as per importance as judged by a wikiproject currently there are importance categories low mid high top and for unclassified unsure level for a particular article different wikiprojects may assign different importance levels the wikipedia version editorial team has developed a table shown below that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance on the english wikipedia if an article or list receives different ratings by two or more wikiprojects then the highest rating is used in the table pie charts and bar chart the software regularly auto updates the data researcher giacomo poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors a study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles note the table above prepared by the wikipedia version editorial team is automatically updated daily by user wp bot but the bar chart and the two pie charts are not auto updated in them new data has to be entered by a wikipedia editor i e user wikipedia receives between and page requests per second depending on time of day page requests are first passed to a front end layer of squid caching servers further statistics based on a publicly available month wikipedia access trace are available requests that cannot be served from the squid cache are sent to load balancing servers running the linux virtual server software which in turn pass them to one of the apache web servers for page rendering from the database the web servers deliver pages as requested performing page rendering for all the language editions of wikipedia to increase speed further rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of linux servers mainly ubuntu as of december there were in florida and in amsterdam by january wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an equinix facility in ashburn virginia in accordance with growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in as recently reported the foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re investment of donations into the internal research and development of the foundation two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a visual editor and a largely under utilized thank tab which were developed for the purpose of ameliorating issues of editor attrition which have met with limited success the estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by adam jaffe who recorded that the range of to annually was to be recommended with high end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment at the level of contributions for wikimedia presently documented as million dollars the computed budget level recommended by jaffe and caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between million and million dollars annually according to the michael porter five forces analysis framework for industry analysis wikipedia and its parent institution wikimedia are known as first movers and radical innovators in the services provided and supported by an open source on line encyclopedia the five forces are centered around the issue of competitive rivalry within the encyclopedia industry where wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its radical innovation the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication this is the first force of porter s five forces analysis the second force is the threat of new entrants with competitive services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web as a first mover wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a fast second to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider of the services which it offers through the world wide web porter s third force is the threat of substitute products and it is too early to identify google s knowledge graphs as an effective competitor given the current dependence of knowledge graphs upon wikipedia s free access to its open source services the fourth force in the porter five forces analysis is the bargaining power of consumers who use the services provided by wikipedia which has historically largely been nullified by the wikipedia founding principle of an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker of being the encyclopedia which anyone can edit the fifth force in the porter five forces analysis is defined as the bargaining power of suppliers presently seen as the open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public libraries world wide and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in the immediate future of the further development of wikipedia community produced news publications include the english wikipedia s the signpost founded in by michael snow an attorney wikipedia administrator and former chair of the wikimedia foundation board of trustees it covers news and events from the site as well as major events from other wikimedia projects such as wikimedia commons similar publications are the german language kurier and the portuguese language correio da wikip dia other past and present community news publications on english wikipedia include the wikiworld web comic the wikipedia weekly podcast and newsletters of specific wikiprojects like the bugle from wikiproject military history and the monthly newsletter from the guild of copy editors there are also a number of publications from the wikimedia foundation and multilingual publications such as the wikimedia blog and this month in education when the project was started in all text in wikipedia was covered by the gnu free documentation license gfdl a copyleft license permitting the redistribution creation of derivative works and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work the gfdl was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the gpl this made it a poor choice for a general reference work for example the gfdl requires the reprints of materials from wikipedia to come with a full copy of the gfdl text in december the creative commons license was released it was specifically designed for creative works in general not just for software manuals the license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the web the wikipedia project sought the switch to the creative commons because the two licenses gfdl and creative commons were incompatible in november following the request of the project the free software foundation fsf released a new version of the gfdl designed specifically to allow wikipedia to relicense its content to cc by sa by august a new version of the gfdl automatically covers wikipedia contents in april wikipedia and its sister projects held a community wide referendum which decided the switch in june the handling of media files e g image files varies across language editions some language editions such as the english wikipedia include non free image files under fair use doctrine while the others have opted not to in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries e g in japanese copyright law media files covered by free content licenses e g creative commons cc by sa are shared across language editions via wikimedia commons repository a project operated by the wikimedia foundation wikipedia s accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text the wikimedia foundation is not a licensor of content but merely a hosting service for the contributors and licensors of the wikipedia this position has been successfully defended in court because wikipedia content is distributed under an open license anyone can reuse or re distribute it at no charge the content of wikipedia has been published in many forms both online and offline outside of the wikipedia website websites thousands of mirror sites exist that republish content from wikipedia two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are reference com and answers com another example is wapedia which began to display wikipedia content in a mobile device friendly format before wikipedia itself did mobile apps a variety of mobile apps provide access to wikipedia on hand held devices including both android and ios devices see wikipedia apps see also mobile access search engines some web search engines make special use of wikipedia content when displaying search results examples include bing via technology gained from powerset and duckduckgo compact discs dvds collections of wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs an english version wikipedia cd selection contained about articles the polish language version contains nearly articles there are german and spanish language versions as well also wikipedia for schools the wikipedia series of cds dvds produced by wikipedians and sos children is a free hand checked non commercial selection from wikipedia targeted around the uk national curriculum and intended to be useful for much of the english speaking world the project is available online an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly volumes books there are efforts to put a select subset of wikipedia s articles into printed book form since tens of thousands of print on demand books which reproduced english german russian and french wikipedia articles have been produced by the american company books llc and by three mauritian subsidiaries of the german publisher vdm semantic web the website dbpedia begun in extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the english language wikipedia wikimedia has created the wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of wikipedia and the other wmf wikis and make it available in a queriable semantic format rdf this is still under development as of feb it has items and properties for describing them obtaining the full contents of wikipedia for reuse presents challenges since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged wikipedia publishes dumps of its contents but these are text only as of there was no dump available of wikipedia s images several languages of wikipedia also maintain a reference desk where volunteers answer questions from the general public according to a study by pnina shachaf in the journal of documentation the quality of the wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk with an accuracy of wikipedia s original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed internet connection although wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since july the new york times on february quoted erik moller deputy director of the wikimedia foundation stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry the the new york times article reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that only percent of the readership of the english language wikipedia comes via mobile devices a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites many of which approach percent and the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more the new york times reports that mr moller has assigned a team of software developers focused on mobile out of a total of approximately employees working at the wikimedia foundation one principal concern cited by the new york times for the worry is for wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment bloomberg businessweek reported in july that google s android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for with of market share over their next closest competitor in ios with of the market at the time of the tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with sue gardner in may wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to wikipedia directly after the posted web interview the representatives stated that wikimedia would be applying an all inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access including blackberry and the windows phone system making market share a secondary issue the latest version of the android app for wikipedia was released on july to generally positive reviews scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately users downloading from google the latest version for ios was released on april to similar reviews access to wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as through the wireless application protocol wap via the wapedia service in june wikipedia launched en mobile wikipedia org an official website for wireless devices in a newer mobile service was officially released located at en m wikipedia org which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iphone android based devices or webos based devices several other methods of mobile access to wikipedia have emerged many devices and applications optimise or enhance the display of wikipedia content for mobile devices while some also incorporate additional features such as use of wikipedia metadata see wikipedia metadata such as geoinformation wikipedia zero is an initiative of the wikimedia foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries wikipedia is extremely popular in february the new york times reported that wikipedia is ranked fifth globally among all websites stating with billion page views and nearly million unique visitors a month wikipedia trails just yahoo facebook microsoft and google the largest with billion unique visitors in addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in about of search engine traffic to wikipedia comes from google a good portion of which is related to academic research the number of readers of wikipedia worldwide reached million at the end of the pew internet and american life project found that one third of us internet users consulted wikipedia in business insider gave wikipedia a valuation of billion if it ran advertisements according to wikipedia readership survey the average age of wikipedia readers is with a rough parity between genders almost half of wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month and a similar number of readers specifically look for wikipedia in search engine results about of wikipedia readers do not realize that wikipedia is a non profit organization wikipedia s content has also been used in academic studies books conferences and court cases the parliament of canada s website refers to wikipedia s article on same sex marriage in the related links section of its further reading list for the civil marriage act the encyclopedia s assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the us federal courts and the world intellectual property organization though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case content appearing on wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some us intelligence agency reports in december the scientific journal rna biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of rna molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the rna family for publication in wikipedia wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism often without attribution and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from wikipedia in time magazine recognized wikipedia s participation along with youtube reddit myspace and facebook in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide in july wikipedia was the focus of a minute documentary on bbc radio which argued that with increased usage and awareness the number of references to wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select band of st century nouns that are so familiar google facebook youtube that they no longer need explanation and are on a par with such th century words as hoovering or coca cola on september italian politician franco grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama he said that the lack of such freedom forced wikipedia the seventh most consulted website to forbid all images of modern italian buildings and art and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues on september the washington post reported that wikipedia had become a focal point in the us election campaign saying type a candidate s name into google and among the first results is a wikipedia page making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate already the presidential entries are being edited dissected and debated countless times each day an october reuters article titled wikipedia page the latest status symbol reported the recent phenomenon of how having a wikipedia article vindicates one s notability active participation also has an impact law students have been assigned to write wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an uninitiated audience wikipedia won two major awards in may the first was a golden nica for digital communities of the annual prix ars electronica contest this came with a grant and an invitation to present at the pae cyberarts festival in austria later that year the second was a judges webby award for the community category wikipedia was also nominated for a best practices webby award in readers of brandchannel com voted wikipedia as the fourth highest brand ranking receiving of the votes in answer to the question which brand had the most impact on our lives in in september wikipedia received quadriga a mission of enlightenment award of werkstatt deutschland along with boris tadi eckart h fling and peter gabriel the award was presented to wales by david weinberger in wikipedia was awarded both the annual erasmus prize which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture society or social sciences and the spanish princess of asturias award on international cooperation many parodies target wikipedia s openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project s articles comedian stephen colbert has parodied or referenced wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show the colbert report and coined the related term wikiality meaning together we can create a reality that we all agree on the reality we just agreed on another example can be found in wikipedia celebrates years of american independence a july front page article in the onion as well as the the onion article l a law wikipedia page viewed times today in an episode of the television comedy the office u s which aired in april an incompetent office manager michael scott is shown relying on a hypothetical wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics in order to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee the tactics he used failed as a joke about the unreliability of wikipedia and what anyone can do to change its contents viewers of the show tried to add the episode s mention of the page as a section of the actual wikipedia article on negotiation but this effort was prevented by other users on the article s talk page my number one doctor a episode of the television show scrubs played on the perception that wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which dr perry cox reacts to a patient who says that a wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the battlestar galactica episode guide in the comedic website collegehumor produced a video sketch named professor wikipedia in which the fictitious professor wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements the dilbert comic strip from may features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying give me ten minutes and then check wikipedia in july bbc radio broadcast a comedy series called bigipedia which was set on a website which was a parody of wikipedia some of the sketches were directly inspired by wikipedia and its articles in comedian daniel tosh encouraged viewers of his show tosh to visit the show s wikipedia article and edit it at will on a later episode he commented on the edits to the article most of them offensive which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing on august the new yorker website published a cartoon with this caption dammit manning have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your wikipedia page wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects which are also wikis run by the wikimedia foundation these other wikimedia projects include wiktionary a dictionary project launched in december wikiquote a collection of quotations created a week after wikimedia launched wikibooks a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts wikimedia commons a site devoted to free knowledge multimedia wikinews for citizen journalism and wikiversity a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities of these only commons has had success comparable to that of wikipedia another sister project of wikipedia wikispecies is a catalogue of species in wikivoyage an editable travel guide and wikidata an editable knowledge base launched the most obvious economic effect of wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias especially the printed versions e g encyclopaedia britannica which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free nicholas carr wrote a essay the amorality of web that criticized websites with user generated content like wikipedia for possibly leading to professional and in his view superior content producers going out of business because free trumps quality all the time carr wrote implicit in the ecstatic visions of web is the hegemony of the amateur i for one can t imagine anything more frightening others dispute the notion that wikipedia or similar efforts will entirely displace traditional publications for instance chris anderson the editor in chief of wired magazine wrote in nature that the wisdom of crowds approach of wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with their rigorous peer review process there is also an ongoing debate about the influence of wikipedia on the biography publishing business the worry is that if you can get all that information from wikipedia what s left for biography said kathryn hughes professor of life writing at uea and author of the short life and long times of mrs beeton and george eliot the last victorian in computational linguistics information retrieval and natural language processing wikipedia has seen widespread use as a corpus for linguistic research in particular it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem which is then called wikification and to the related problem of word sense disambiguation methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find missing links in wikipedia a number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before wikipedia was founded the first of these was the bbc domesday project which included text entered on bbc micro computers and photographs from over million contributors in the uk and covered the geography art and culture of the uk this was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the uk the user interface and part of the content of the domesday project were emulated on a website until one of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h g which was created by douglas adams the h g encyclopedia is relatively light hearted focusing on articles which are both witty and informative everything was created in all of these projects had similarities with wikipedia but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges to public users gne an encyclopedia which was not a wiki also created in january co existed with nupedia and wikipedia early in its history however it has been retired other websites centered on collaborative knowledge base development have drawn inspiration from wikipedia some such as susning nu enciclopedia libre hudong and baidu baike likewise employ no formal review process although some like conservapedia are not as open others use more traditional peer review such as encyclopedia of life and the online wiki encyclopedias scholarpedia and citizendium the latter was started by sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to wikipedia special searches all pages with titles containing wikipedia all pages beginning with wikipedia official website mobile multilingual portal contains links to all language editions wikipedia on twitter wikipedia on facebook wikipedia at dmoz wikitrends wikipedia articles most visited today wikipedia collected news and commentary at the guardian wikipedia topic page at the new york times video of ted talk by jimmy wales on the birth of
