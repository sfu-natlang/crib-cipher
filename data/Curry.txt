 curry k ri plural curries is a dish whose origins are in south and southeast asian cuisines the common feature is the incorporation of complex combinations of spices or herbs usually including fresh or dried hot chillies some limit the use of the term curry to dishes prepared in a sauce but curries may be wet or dry a curry dish may be spiced with leaves from the curry tree but many curries do not have this ingredient in original traditional cuisines the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition religious practice and to some extent family preference such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients spicing and cooking methods traditionally spices are used both whole and ground cooked or raw and they may be added at different times during the cooking process to produce different results curry powder a commercially prepared mixture of spices is largely a western notion dating to the th century such mixtures are commonly thought to have first been prepared by indian merchants for sale to members of the british colonial government and army returning to britain dishes called curry may contain meat poultry fish or shellfish either alone or in combination with vegetables many are instead entirely vegetarian especially among those who hold ethical or religious proscriptions against eating meat or seafood curries may be either wet or dry wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on yoghurt coconut milk legume pur e dal or stock dry curries are cooked with very little liquid which is allowed to evaporate leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture the main spices found in most south asian curry powders are turmeric coriander and cumin a wide range of additional spices may be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included white red meat fish lentils rice and vegetables curry was adopted and anglicised from the tamil word ka r i meaning sauce which is usually understood to mean vegetables and or meat cooked with spices with or without a gravy according to this theory kari was first encountered in the mid th century by members of the british east india company trading with tamil indian merchants along the coromandel coast of southeast india particularly at fort st george later called madras and renamed chennai in here they became familiar with a spice blend used for making kari dishes called kari podi or curry powder a further explanation put forward in the flavours of history claims the origins of the word curry to be from old english first recorded in the forme of cury dishes of highly spiced meat are thought to have originated in pre historic times among the inhabitants of the indus valley civilization archaeological evidence dating to bce from mohenjo daro suggests the use of mortar and pestle to pound spices including mustard fennel cumin and tamarind pods with which they flavoured food such dishes are also recorded during the vedic period of indian history roughly to bce spiced dishes in the indian style were apparently carried eastward to burma thailand and china by buddhist monks in the th century ce and carried southwards to indonesia the philippines and elsewhere by coastal traders at about the same time the establishment of the mughal empire beginning in the early th century transformed much of older indian cuisine especially in the north another influence was the establishment of the portuguese trading centre in goa in resulting in the first introduction of the chili pepper to india as a byproduct of the columbian exchange from the mid th century curry has been increasingly popular in great britain during the th century curry was also carried to the caribbean by indian indentured workers in the british sugar industry since the mid th century curries of many national styles have become popular far from their origins and increasingly become part of international fusion cuisine from the culinary point of view it is useful to consider the south asia to be the entire historical region encompassed prior to independence in august that is the modern countries of india sri lanka pakistan and bangladesh it is usual to distinguish broadly between northern and southern styles of indian cuisine recognising that within those categories are innumerable sub styles and variations the distinction is commonly made with reference to the staple starch wheat in the form of unleavened breads in the north rice in the east rice and millet in the south the
