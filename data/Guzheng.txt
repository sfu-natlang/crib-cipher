instruments such as the japanese koto the korean gayageum and the vietnamese n tranh the guzheng should not be confused with the guqin another ancient chinese zither with no moveable bridges the early types of guzheng emerged during the warring states period to bce it was largely influenced by the se it became prominent during the qin period to bce and by the tang dynasty ce to ce the guzheng was arguably the most commonly played instrument in china musicological studies in the late th century indicate that early bamboo tube zithers might be one of the prototypes of the guzheng koto gayageum and the n tranh the modern zheng is very different from ones made centuries ago mainly due to natural evolution influenced by local as well as historical environments but also because of the adoption of western musical styles strings were once made from silk but now they are almost always metal nylon which increased the instrument s capabilities volume and timbre there are many techniques used in the playing of the guzheng including basic plucking actions right or both hands at the right portion and pressing actions at the left portion by the left hand to produce pitch ornamentations and vibrato as well as tremolo right hand these techniques of playing the guzheng can create sounds that can evoke the sense of a cascading waterfall thunder horses hooves and even the scenic countryside plucking is done mainly by the right hand with four plectra picks attached to the fingers advanced players may use picks attached to the fingers of both hands in more traditional performances however plectra are used solely on the right hand reflecting its use for melodic purposes and its relative importance in comparison to the left hand which is used solely for purposes of ornamentation ancient picks were made of ivory and later also from tortoise shell ornamentation includes a tremolo involving the right thumb and index finger rapidly and repeatedly plucking the same note another commonly used ornamentation is a wide vibrato achieved by repeatedly pressing with the left hand on the left side of the bridge this technique is used liberally in chinese music as well as in korean gayageum music in arrangements of guqin pieces harmonics are frequently used along with single string glissandi evoking the sound of the guqin harmonics are achieved by lightly placing the left hand in the middle of the string while plucking on the right end of string the guzheng s pentatonic scale is tuned to do re mi so and la but fa and ti can also be produced by pressing the strings to the left of the bridges well known pieces for the instrument include yu zhou chang wan songs of fishing boats at dusk gao shan liu shui high mountains flowing water mei hua san nong three variations of the plum

left hand in more traditional music students of the guzheng who take the beijing conservatory examinations are required to learn a repertoire of pieces both traditional and modern the guzheng has been
