1. Greedy.

Learn whatever you can, no matter what.
Given the crib KILL and ??L?, learn all three unknown symbols as K, I and L, respectively.


2. One letter at most.

Only learn up to one letter.
Given ?ILL, you can learn ?=K. Otherwise don't bother, as you risk mislearning.


3. Only if no other word would fit.

Learn only when no other word could possibly match the current pattern of unknowns.
K??L is unlearnable because it could also be KEEL or KOHL. K?LL is fine and you can learn ?=I.


4. Probabilistic.

Depending on some notion of likelyhood.
K??L should be learnable as KILL because KEEL occurs much rarer than KILL does.
(Unless the cipher is in some kind of nautical domain, in which case tough luck.)
